A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit$# Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets$# Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country banks are highly regulated in most countries$# Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities$# In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards known as the Basel Accords$# Banking in its modern sense evolved in the th century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world$# In the history of banking a number of banking dynasties – notably the Medicis the Fuggers the Welsers the Berenbergs and the Rothschilds – have played a central role over many centuries$# The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank$#   Banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities$# This began around BC in Assyria and Babylonia$# Later in ancient Greece and during the Roman Empire lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations: they accepted deposits and changed money$# Archaeology from this period in ancient China and India also shows evidence of money lending activity$# The origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance Italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like Florence Lucca Siena Venice and Genoa$# The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in th-century Florence establishing branches in many other parts of Europe$# One of the most famous Italian banks was the Medici Bank set up by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici in $# The earliest known state deposit bank Banco di San Giorgio was founded in at Genoa Italy$# Modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries$# Merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service$# In exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee; these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods$#  Gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith$# The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits$# Since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking$# The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default$# Thus the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit$# The Bank of England was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in $# The Royal Bank of Scotland established the first overdraft facility in $# By the beginning of the th century a bankers' clearing house was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions$# The Rothschilds pioneered international finance on a large scale financing the purchase of the Suez canal for the British government$#   The word bank was borrowed in Middle English from Middle French banque from Old Italian banca meaning "table" from Old High German banc bank "bench counter"$# Benches were used as makeshift desks or exchange counters during the Renaissance by Jewish Florentine bankers who used to make their transactions atop desks covered by green tablecloths$#   The definition of a bank varies from country to country$# See the relevant country pages under for more information$# Under English common law a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking which is specified as: conducting current accounts for his customers paying cheques drawn on him/her and collecting cheques for his/her customers$#  In most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments including cheques and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term banker: banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking' $# Although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated$# The business of banking is in many English common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above$# In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business$# When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general$# In particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking$# However in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one$# Examples of statutory definitions: "banking business" means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act; Section Interpretation)$# "banking business" means the business of either or both of the following: receiving from the general public money on current deposit savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [ months] $# $# $# or with a period of call or notice of less than that period; paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers$# Since the advent of EFTPOS direct credit direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument$# This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties even if they do not pay and collect cheques $#   Banks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers paying cheques drawn by customers in the bank and collecting cheques deposited to customers' current accounts$# Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as Automated Clearing House Wire transfers or telegraphic transfer EFTPOS and automated teller machines $# Banks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts by accepting term deposits and by issuing debt securities such as banknotes and bonds$# Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts by making installment loans and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending$# Banks provide different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals$# Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account$# Banks can create new money when they make a loan$# New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system$# The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated$# In the United Kingdom between and there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt$# The amount of money in the economy as measured by M in the UK went from £ billion to £ billion between and much of the increase caused by bank lending$# If all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase$# Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after $#   Activities undertaken by banks include personal banking corporate banking investment banking private banking transaction banking insurance consumer finance foreign exchange trading commodity trading trading in equities futures and options trading and money market trading$#   Banks offer many different channels to access their banking and other services:

for the bank based on a contract$# Its main job is to increase the customer base for the bank$#   A bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice$# Traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customers$# The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities$# This difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate$# Historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle$# Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance$# In the past years American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions$# First this includes the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses$# Merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for "one-stop shopping" by enabling cross-selling of products $# Second they have expanded the use of risk-based pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans$# This helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit$# Third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients$# These products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards$# They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time $# However with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt$# Banks make money from card

are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability and how much capital a bank is required to hold$# Bank capital consists principally of equity retained earnings and subordinated debt$# After the - financial crisis regulators force banks to issue Contingent convertible bonds $# These are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses in accordance with their contractual terms when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level$# Then debt is reduced and bank capitalization gets a boost$# Owing to their capacity to absorb losses CoCos have the potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirement$# Some of the main risks faced by banks include: Credit risk: risk of loss arising from a borrower who does not make payments as promised$# Liquidity risk: risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss $# Market risk: risk that the value of a portfolio either an investment portfolio or a trading portfolio will decrease due to the change in value of the market risk factors$# Operational risk: risk arising from execution of a company's business functions$# Reputational risk: a type of risk related to the trustworthiness of business$# Macroeconomic risk: risks related to the aggregate economy the bank is operating in$# The capital requirement is a bank regulation which sets a framework within which a bank or depository institution must manage its balance sheet$# The categorization of assets and capital is highly standardized so that it can be risk weighted$#    The economic functions of banks include: Issue of money in the form of banknotes and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customer's order$# These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par$# They are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash$# Netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments$# This enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other$# It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them$# Credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own account as middle men$# Credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers but are high quality borrowers$# The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations$# However banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position$# Asset liability mismatch/Maturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans$# In other words they borrow short and lend long$# With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues and redemptions maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources $# Money creation/destruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractional-reserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed$#   Banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises$# These include liquidity risk credit risk and interest rate risk $# Banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole$# Prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the Great Depression the U$#

branches in the   Currently commercial banks are regulated in most jurisdictions by government entities and require a special bank license to operate$# Usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customer's order – although money lending by itself is generally not included in the definition$# Unlike most other regulated industries the regulator is typically also a participant in the market being either a publicly or privately governed central bank$# Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes$# However in some countries this is not the case$# In the UK for example the Financial Services Authority licenses banks and some commercial banks issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the Bank of England the UK government's central bank$# Banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account$# The law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows: The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer: when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank$# The bank agrees to pay the customer's checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer's account plus any agreed overdraft limit$# The bank may not pay from the customer's account without a mandate from the customer e$# g$# a cheque drawn by the customer$# The bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customer's account as the customer's agent and to credit the proceeds to the customer's account$# The bank has a right to combine the customer's accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship$# The bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customer's account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank$# The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer's account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the bank's interests require it or the law demands it$# The bank must not close a customer's account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days$# These implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank$# The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship$# Some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules$# The requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include: Minimum capital Minimum capital ratio 'Fit and Proper' requirements for the bank's controllers owners directors or senior officers Approval of the bank's business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible$#   Banks' activities can be divided into: retail banking dealing directly with individuals and small businesses; business banking providing services to mid-market business; corporate banking directed at large business entities; private banking providing wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals and families; investment banking relating to activities on the financial markets$# Most banks are profit-making private enterprises$# However some are owned by government or are non-profit organizations$#   Commercial banks: the term used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank$# After the Great Depression the U$# S$# Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities whereas investment banks were limited to capital market activities$# Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership some use the term "commercial bank" to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses$# Community banks: locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and the partners$# Community development banks: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations$# Land

Credit unions or co-operative banks: not-for-profit cooperatives owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favourable than for-profit banks$# Typically membership is restricted to employees of a particular company residents of a defined area members of a certain union or religious organizations and their immediate families$# Postal savings banks: savings banks associated with national postal systems$# Private banks: banks that manage the assets of high-net-worth individuals$# Historically a minimum of USD million was required to open an account however over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to USD for private investors$# Offshore banks: banks located in jurisdictions with low taxation and regulation$# Many offshore banks are essentially private banks$# Savings bank: in Europe savings banks took their roots in the th or sometimes even in the th century$# Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population$# In some countries savings banks were created on public initiative; in others socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure$# Nowadays European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments savings products credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises$# Apart from this retail focus they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network providing local and regional outreach – and by their socially responsible approach to business and society$# Building societies and Landesbanks: institutions that conduct retail banking$# Ethical banks: banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments$# A direct or internet-only bank is a banking operation without any physical bank branches conceived and implemented wholly with networked computers$#   Investment banks "underwrite" stock and bond issues trade for their own accounts make markets provide investment management and advise corporations on capital market activities such as mergers and acquisitions$# Merchant banks were traditionally banks which engaged in trade finance$# The modern definition however refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans$# Unlike venture caps they tend not to invest in new companies$#   Universal banks more commonly known as financial services companies engage in several of these activities$# These big banks are very diversified groups that among other services also distribute insurance – hence the term bancassurance a portmanteau word combining "banque or bank" and "assurance" signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity$#   Central banks are normally government-owned and charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities such as supervising commercial banks or controlling the cash interest rate$# They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the lender of last resort in event of a crisis$# Islamic banks adhere to the concepts of Islamic law$# This form of banking revolves around several well-established principles based on Islamic canons$# All banking activities must avoid interest a concept that is forbidden in Islam$# Instead the bank earns profit and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers$#     The United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators$# All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as a regulator$# However for soundness examinations the Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is the primary federal regulator for national banks; and the Office of Thrift Supervision or OTS is the primary federal regulator for thrifts$# State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC$# National banks have one primary regulator – the OCC$# Each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere$# The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council was established in as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions$# Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing$# In addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve FDIC OTS and OCC$# Offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut$# The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator$# While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks$# The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States$# The changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations$# It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market$# A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders$# The management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment$# Loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core$# While always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions$#  There are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times$# ” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management$# Problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered$# In addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs$# Banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups$# Across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing$# Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections$# Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk$# Banking is also an extremely competitive industry$# Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies credit unions cheque cashing services credit card companies etc$# As a reaction banks have developed their activities in financial instruments through financial market operations such as brokerage and have become big players in such activities$#   To be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed banks must compete for deposits$# The phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as U$# S$# Department of Treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt$# One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits$# To compete for deposits US savings institutions offer many different types of plans: Passbook or ordinary deposit accounts – permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time$# NOW and Super NOW accounts – function like checking accounts but

regularly to meet certain goals$#   Bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world$# Under GAAP there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit$# Credit accounts are Revenue Equity and Liabilities$# Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses$# The bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance$# The customer debits his or her savings/bank account in his ledger when making a deposit while the customer credits a credit card account in his ledger every time he spends money $# When the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds$# The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement$# If the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement$#   One source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations$# This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors$# It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits$# Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or "hot money" as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits$# This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank$# Banks which failed during and in the United States during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank$# Such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s$# Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits$# There are different types of accounts: saving recurring and current accounts$#   In modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry$# Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as Bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk$# The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities$# However despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries$# In the USA for instance very few banks even worry about the Riegle–Neal Act which promotes more efficient interstate banking$# In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation$# One reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals$# On the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporation's financial information is

Financial Planning Standards Board are: Financial position: is concerned with understanding the personal resources available by examining net worth and household cash flow$# Net worth is a person's balance sheet calculated by adding up all assets under that person's control minus all liabilities of the household at one point in time$# Household cash flow totals up all the expected sources of income within a year minus all expected expenses within the same year$# From this analysis the financial planner can determine to what degree and in what time the personal goals can be accomplished$# Adequate protection: the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks$# These risks can be divided into the following: liability property death disability health and long term care$# Some of these risks may be self-insurable while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract$# Determining how much insurance to get at the most cost effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance$# Business owners professionals athletes and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves$# Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits utilizing insurance investment products may be a critical piece of the overall investment planning$# Tax planning: typically the income tax is the single largest expense in a household$# Managing taxes is not a question of if you will pay taxes but when and how much$# Government gives many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden$# Most modern governments use a progressive tax$# Typically as one's income grows a higher marginal rate of tax must be paid$# Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one's personal finances can make a significant impact in which it can later save you money in the long term$# Investment and accumulation goals: planning how to accumulate enough money – for large purchases and life events – is what most people consider to be financial planning$# Major reasons to accumulate assets include purchasing a house or car starting a business paying for education expenses and saving for retirement$# Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost and when you need to withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals$# A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time or inflation$# Using net present value calculators the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments$# In order to overcome the rate of inflation the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks$# Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity$# This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks bonds cash and alternative investments$# The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor since risk attitudes vary from person to person$# Retirement planning is the process of understanding how much it costs to live at retirement and coming up with a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall$# Methods for retirement plan include taking advantage of government allowed structures to manage tax liability including: individual structures or employer sponsored retirement plans$# Estate planning involves planning for the disposition of one's assets after death$# Typically there is a tax due to the state or federal government at one's death$# Avoiding these taxes means that more of one's assets will be distributed to one's heirs$# One can leave one's assets to family friends or charitable groups$#   Corporate finance deals with the sources funding and the capital structure of corporations the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources$# Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms$# Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability while attempting to maximize an entity's assets net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation$# In the first "capital budgeting" management must choose which "projects" to undertake$# The discipline of capital budgeting may employ standard business valuation techniques or even extend to real options valuation; see Financial modeling$# The second "sources of capital" relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources such as by shareholders in the form of equity creditors often in the form of bonds and the firm's operations $# Short-term funding or working capital is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit$# The balance between these elements forms the company's capital structure$# The third "the dividend policy" requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements or instead to be distributed to shareholders and if so in what form$# Short term financial management is often termed "working capital management" and relates to cash- inventory- and debtors management$# Corporate finance also includes within its scope business valuation stock investing or investment management$# An investment is an acquisition of an asset in the hope that it will maintain or increase its value over time that will in hope give back a higher rate of return when it comes to disbursing dividends$# In investment management – in choosing a portfolio – one has to use financial analysis to determine what how much and when to invest$# To do this a company must: Identify relevant objectives and constraints: institution or individual goals time horizon risk aversion and tax considerations; Identify the appropriate strategy: active versus passive hedging strategy Measure the portfolio performance Financial management overlaps with the financial function of the accounting profession$# However financial accounting is the reporting of historical financial information while financial management is concerned with the allocation of capital resources to increase a firm's value to the shareholders and increase their rate of return on the investments$# Financial risk management an element of corporate finance is the practice of creating and protecting economic value in a firm by using financial instruments to manage exposure to risk particularly credit risk and market risk$#  It focuses on when and how to hedge using financial instruments; in this sense it overlaps with financial engineering$# Similar to general risk management financial risk management requires identifying its sources measuring it and formulating plans to address these and can be qualitative and quantitative$# In the banking sector worldwide the Basel Accords are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking reporting and exposing operational credit and market risks$#   An entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess income to help that excess income produce more income in the future$# Though on the other hand an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims decreasing its expenses or increasing its income$# The lender can find a borrower—a financial intermediary such as a bank—or buy notes or bonds in the bond market$# The lender receives interest the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan$# A bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders$# A bank accepts deposits from lenders on which it pays interest$# The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers$# Banks allow borrowers and lenders of different sizes to coordinate their activity$# Finance is used by individuals by governments by businesses and by a wide variety of other organizations such as schools and non-profit organizations$# In general the goals of each of the above activities are achieved through the use of appropriate financial instruments and methodologies with consideration to their institutional setting$# Finance is one of the most important aspects of business management and includes analysis related to the use and acquisition of funds for the enterprise$# In corporate finance a company's capital structure is the total mix of financing methods it uses to raise funds$# One method is debt financing which includes bank loans and bond sales$# Another method is equity financing – the sale of stock by a company to investors the original shareholders of a share$# Ownership of a share gives the shareholder certain contractual rights and powers which typically include the right to receive declared dividends and to vote the proxy on important matters $# The owners of both bonds and stock may be institutional investors – financial institutions such as investment banks and pension funds or private individuals called private investors or retail investors$#   Public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states and sub-national entities and related public entities or agencies$# It usually encompasses a long-term strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities$# These long-term strategic periods usually encompass five or more years$# Public finance is primarily concerned with: Identification of required expenditure of a public sector entity Source of that entity's revenue The budgeting process Debt issuance for public works projects Central banks such as the Federal Reserve System banks in the United States and Bank of England in the United Kingdom are strong players in public finance acting as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy$#   Capital in the financial sense is the money that gives the business the power to buy goods to be used in the production of other goods or the offering of a service$# $# The deployment of capital is decided by the budget$# This may include the objective of business targets set and results in financial terms e$# g$# the target set for sale resulting cost growth required investment to achieve the planned sales and financing source for the investment$# A budget may be long term or short term$# Long term budgets have a time horizon of – years giving a vision to the company; short term is an annual budget which is drawn to control and operate in that particular year$# Budgets will include proposed fixed asset requirements and how these expenditures will be financed$# Capital budgets are often adjusted annually and should be part of a longer-term Capital Improvements Plan$# A cash budget is also required$# The working capital requirements of a business are monitored at all times to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to meet short-term expenses$# The cash budget is basically a detailed plan that shows all expected sources and uses of cash when it comes to spending it appropriately$# The cash budget has the following six main sections: Beginning Cash Balance – contains the last period's closing cash balance in other words the remaining cash from last years earnings$# Cash collections – includes all expected cash receipts Cash disbursements – lists all planned cash outflows for the period such as dividend excluding interest payments on short-term loans which appear in the financing section$# All expenses that do not affect cash flow are excluded from this list Cash excess or deficiency – a function of the cash needs and cash available$# Cash needs are determined by the total cash disbursements plus the minimum cash balance required by company policy$# If total cash available is less than cash needs a deficiency exists$# Financing – discloses the planned borrowings and repayments of those planned borrowings including interest$#     Financial economics is the branch of economics studying the interrelation of financial variables such as prices interest rates and shares as opposed to goods and services$# Financial economics concentrates on influences of real economic variables on financial ones in contrast to pure finance$# It centres on managing risk in the context of the financial markets and the resultant economic and financial models$# It essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of an investment policy$# Here the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory and to the Black–Scholes theory for option valuation; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold or are extended$# "Financial economics" at least formally also considers investment under "certainty" and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory$# Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested$# Although closely related the disciplines of economics and finance are distinctive$# The “economy” is a social institution that organizes a society’s production distribution and consumption of goods and services all of which must be financed$# Economists make a number of abstract assumptions for purposes of their analyses and predictions$# They generally regard financial markets that function for the financial system as an efficient mechanism $# Instead financial markets are subject to human error and emotion$# New research discloses the mischaracterization of investment safety and measures of financial products and markets so complex that their effects especially under conditions of uncertainty are impossible to predict$# The study of finance is subsumed under economics as financial economics but the scope speed power relations and practices of the financial system can uplift or cripple whole economies and the well-being of households businesses and governing bodies within them—sometimes in a single day$#   Financial mathematics is a field of applied mathematics concerned with financial markets$# The subject has a close relationship with the discipline of financial economics which is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics$# Generally mathematical finance will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics$# In terms of practice mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the field of computational finance $# Arguably these are largely synonymous although the latter focuses on application while the former focuses on modelling and derivation $# The field is largely focused on the modelling of derivatives although other important subfields include insurance mathematics and quantitative portfolio problems$# See Outline of finance: Mathematical tools; Outline of finance: Derivatives pricing$#   Experimental finance aims to establish different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows information diffusion and aggregation price setting mechanisms and returns processes$# Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions$# Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior and the way that these people act or react of people in artificial competitive market-like settings$#   Behavioral finance studies how the psychology of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas$# Behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become central and very important to finance$# Behavioral finance includes such topics as: Empirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories$# Models of how psychology affects and impacts trading and prices Forecasting based on these methods$# Studies of experimental asset markets and use of models to forecast experiments$# A strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed Quantitative Behavioral Finance which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation$# Some of these endeavors has been led by Gunduz Caginalp and collaborators including Vernon Smith David Porter Don Balenovich Vladimira Ilieva Ahmet Duran)$# Studies by Jeff Madura Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant behavioral effects in stocks and exchange traded funds$# Among other topics quantitative behavioral finance studies behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets$#   There are several related professional qualifications that can lead to the field: Generalist Finance qualifications: Degrees: Master of Science

Finance Knowledge Project – aimed to offer free access to finance knowledge for students teachers and self-learners$# Professor Aswath Damodaran – provides resources covering three areas in finance: corporate finance valuation and investment management and syndicate finance$#  An investment bank is typically a private company that provides various financial-related and other services to individuals corporations and governments such as raising financial capital by underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of securities$# An investment bank may also assist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions and provide ancillary services such as market making trading of derivatives and equity securities and FICC services $# Unlike commercial banks and retail banks investment banks do not take deposits$# From the passage of Glass–Steagall Act in until its repeal in by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act the United States maintained a separation between investment banking and commercial banks$# Other industrialized countries including G countries have historically not maintained such a separation$# As part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of  the Volcker Rule asserts some institutional separations of investment banking services from commercial banking$# The two main lines of business in investment banking are called the sell side and the buy side$# The "sell side" involves trading securities for cash or for other securities or the promotion of securities $# The "buy side" involves the provision of advice to institutions that buy investment services$# Private equity funds mutual funds life insurance companies unit trusts and hedge funds are the most common types of buy-side entities$# An investment bank can also be split into private and public functions with a Chinese wall separating the two to prevent information from crossing$# The private areas of the bank deal with private insider information that may not be publicly disclosed while the public areas such as stock analysis deal with public information$# An advisor who provides investment banking services in the United States must be a licensed broker-dealer and subject to U$# S$# Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority regulation$#   The Dutch East India Company became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public$# In other words the VOC was officially the first publicly traded company because it was the first company to be ever actually listed on an official stock exchange$# It was also the Dutch who helped lay the foundations for modern practice of investment banking$# Investment banking has changed over the years beginning as a partnership form focused on underwriting security issuance i$# e$# initial public offerings and secondary market offerings brokerage and mergers and acquisitions and evolving into a "full-service" range including securities research proprietary trading and investment management$# In the modern st century the SEC filings of the major independent investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reflect three product segments: investment banking ; asset management and trading and principal investments and brokerage trading )$# In the United States commercial banking and investment banking were separated by the Glass–Steagall Act which was repealed in $# The repeal led to more "universal banks" offering an even greater range of services$# Many large commercial banks have therefore developed investment banking divisions through acquisitions and hiring$# Notable large banks with significant investment banks include JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Credit Suisse Deutsche Bank UBS Barclays and Wells Fargo$# After the financial crisis of – and the subsequent passage of the Dodd-Frank Act of regulations have limited certain investment banking operations notably with the Volcker Rule's restrictions on proprietary trading$# The traditional service of underwriting security issues has declined as a percentage of revenue$# As far back as % of Merrill Lynch's revenue was derived from transaction commissions while "traditional investment banking" services accounted for %$# However Merrill Lynch was a relatively "retail-focused" firm with a large brokerage network$#    Investment banking is split into front office middle office and back office activities$# While large service investment banks offer all lines of business both "sell side" and "buy side" smaller sell-side investment firms such as boutique investment banks and small broker-dealers focus on investment banking and sales/trading/research respectively$# Investment banks offer services to both corporations issuing securities and investors buying securities$# For corporations investment bankers offer information on when and how to place their securities on the open market an activity very important to an investment bank's reputation$# Therefore investment bankers play a very important role in issuing new security offerings$#   Front office is generally described as a revenue generating role$# There are two main areas within front office: investment banking and markets: Investment banking involves advising the world's largest organizations on mergers and acquisitions as well as a wide array of fund raising strategies$# Markets is divided into "sales and trading" and "research"$#   Corporate finance is the traditional aspect of investment banks which involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers and acquisitions ; this may involve subscribing investors to a security issuance coordinating with bidders or negotiating with a merger target$# A pitch book of financial information is generated to market the bank to a potential M&A client; if the pitch is successful the bank arranges the deal for the client$# The investment banking division is generally divided into industry coverage and product coverage groups$# Industry coverage groups focus on a specific industry—such as healthcare public finance FIG industrials TMT P&E consumer/retail food & beverage corporate defense and governance—and maintain relationships with corporations within the industry to bring in business for the bank$# Product coverage groups focus on financial products—such as mergers and acquisitions leveraged finance public finance asset finance and leasing structured finance restructuring equity and high-grade debt—and generally work and collaborate with industry groups on the more intricate and specialized needs of a client$#   On behalf of the bank and its clients a large investment bank's primary function is buying and selling products$# In market making traders will buy and sell financial products with the goal of making money on each trade$# Sales is the term for the investment bank's sales force whose primary job is to call on institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas and take orders$# Sales desks then communicate their clients' orders to the appropriate trading rooms which can price and execute trades or structure new products that fit a specific need$# Structuring has been a relatively recent activity as derivatives have come into play with highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured products which typically offer much greater margins and returns than underlying cash securities$# In investment banks came under pressure as a result of selling complex derivatives contracts to local municipalities in Europe and the Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the strategies that can be adopted in various markets$# Ranging from derivatives to specific industries strategists place companies and industries in a quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene$# This strategy often affects the way the firm will operate in the market the direction it would like to take in terms of its proprietary and flow positions the suggestions salespersons give to clients as well as the way structurers create new products$# Banks also undertake risk through proprietary trading performed by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and through "principal risk"—risk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a product to a client and does not hedge his total exposure$# Banks seek to maximize profitability for a given amount of risk on their balance sheet$# The necessity for numerical ability in sales and trading has created jobs for physics computer science mathematics and engineeringD$# s who act as quantitative analysts$#   The securities research division reviews companies and writes reports about their prospects often with "buy" "hold" or "sell" ratings$# Investment banks typically have sell-side analysts which cover various industries$# Their sponsored funds or proprietary trading offices will also have buy-side research$# While the research division may or may not generate revenue its resources are used to assist traders in trading the sales force in suggesting ideas to customers and investment bankers by covering their clients$# Research also serves outside clients with investment advice in the hopes that these clients will execute suggested trade ideas through the sales and trading division of the bank and thereby generate revenue for the firm$# Research also covers credit research fixed income research macroeconomic research and quantitative analysis all of which are used internally and externally to advise clients but do not directly affect revenue$# All research groups nonetheless provide a key service in terms of advisory and strategy$# There is a potential conflict of interest between the investment bank and its analysis in that published analysis can impact the performance of a security or influence the relationship between the banker and its corporate clients thereby affecting the bank's profitability $#    Risk management involves analyzing the market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades$# Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities such as syndicated loans bond issuance restructuring and leveraged finance$# Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers$# Other risk groups include country risk operational risk and counterparty risks which may or may not exist on a bank to bank basis$# Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions involving debt structuring exit financing loan amendment

functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities$# Risk management is a broad area and like research its roles can be client-facing or internal$#   This area of the bank includes treasury management internal controls and internal corporate strategy$# Corporate treasury is responsible for an investment bank's funding capital structure management and liquidity risk monitoring$# Internal control tracks and analyzes the capital flows of the firm the finance division is the principal adviser to senior management on essential areas such as controlling the firm's global risk exposure and the profitability and structure of the firm's various businesses via dedicated trading desk product control teams$# In the United States and United Kingdom a comptroller is a senior position often reporting to the chief financial officer$# Internal corporate strategy tackling firm management and profit strategy unlike corporate strategy groups that advise clients is non-revenue regenerating yet a key functional role within

management is the professional management of various securities and other assets to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors$# Investors may be institutions or private investors $# The investment management division of an investment bank is generally divided into separate groups often known as private wealth management and private client services$# Merchant banking can be called "very personal banking"; merchant banks offer capital in exchange for share ownership rather than loans and offer advice on management and strategy$# Merchant banking is also a name used to describe

investment banks were estimated at $ billion down about a third from as companies pursued less deals and traded less$# Differences in total revenue are likely due to different ways of classifying investment banking revenue such as subtracting proprietary trading revenue$# In terms of total revenue SEC filings of the major independent investment banks in the United States show that investment banking only made up about -% of total revenue for these banks from to with the majority of revenue brought in by "trading" which includes brokerage commissions and proprietary trading; the proprietary trading is estimated to provide a significant portion of this revenue$# The United States generated % of global revenue in down from % in $# Europe generated about a third while Asian countries generated the remaining %$# The industry is heavily concentrated in a small number of major financial centers including City of London New York City Frankfurt Hong Kong and Tokyo$# According to estimates published by the International Financial Services London for the decade prior to the financial crisis in M&A was a primary source of investment banking revenue often accounting for % of such revenue but dropped during and after the financial crisis$# Equity underwriting revenue ranged from % to % and fixed-income underwriting accounted for the remaining revenue$# Revenues have been affected by the introduction of new products with higher margins; however these innovations are often copied quickly by competing banks pushing down trading margins$# For example brokerages commissions for bond and equity trading is a commodity business but structuring and trading derivatives has higher margins because each over-the-counter contract has to be uniquely structured and could involve complex pay-off and risk profiles$# One growth area is private investment in public equity $# Such transactions are privately negotiated between companies and accredited investors$# Banks also earned revenue by securitizing debt particularly mortgage debt prior to the financial crisis$# Investment banks have become concerned that lenders are securitizing in-house driving the investment banks to pursue vertical integration by becoming lenders which is allowed in the United States since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in $#  === Top banks === According to the Financial

markets$# Eventually taxpayer assistance to banks reached nearly $ trillion most without much scrutiny lending did not increase and credit markets remained frozen$# The crisis led to questioning of the business model of the investment bank without the regulation imposed on it by Glass-Steagall$# Once Robert Rubin a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs became part of the Clinton administration and deregulated banks the previous conservatism of underwriting established companies and seeking long-term gains was replaced by lower standards and short-term profit$# Formerly the guidelines said that in order to take a company public it had to be in business for a minimum of five years and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years$# After deregulation those standards were gone but small investors did not grasp the full impact of the change$# A number of former Goldman Sachs top executives such as Henry Paulson and Ed Liddy were in high-level positions in government and oversaw

criticised for its opacity$#   Conflicts of interest may arise between different parts of a bank creating the potential for market manipulation according to critics$# Authorities that regulate investment banking such as the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and the SEC in the United States require that banks impose a "Chinese wall" to prevent communication between investment banking on one side and equity research and trading on the other$# However critics say such a barrier does not always exist in practice$# Independent advisory firms that exclusively provide corporate finance advice argue that their advice is not conflicted unlike bulge bracket banks$# Conflicts of interest often arise in relation to investment banks' equity research units which have long been part of the industry$# A common practice is for equity analysts to initiate coverage of a company in order to develop relationships that lead to highly profitable investment banking business$# In the s many equity researchers allegedly traded positive stock ratings for investment banking business$# Alternatively companies may threaten to divert investment banking business to competitors unless their stock was rated favorably$# Laws were passed to criminalize such acts and increased pressure from regulators and a series of lawsuits settlements and prosecutions curbed this business to a large extent following the stock market tumble after the dot-com bubble$# Philip Augar author of The Greed Merchants said in an interview that "You cannot simultaneously serve the interest of issuer clients
